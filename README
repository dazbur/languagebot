This was supposed to be a project that helps me to learn new words
using Twitter.

The idea is to send new words and their meanings to a twitter bot and it will
then start spitting those words back to you using Spaced Repetition (http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition?2) to vary intervals. It will also do a quiz
from time to time asking meaning of the word and adjust your score accordingly.

All these menagerie is running on Google Apps Engine platform â€” http://langbot-stage.appspot.com/login

Right now project is in a kind of frozen state and needs a mojor cleanup.
